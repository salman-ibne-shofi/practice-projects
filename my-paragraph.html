          Few animals on earth are as important as cows. They have been tamed
          and used by man for thousands of years. We mainly depend on them for
          our food. In some countries, people use cow’s meat as a significant
          source of food. Cows are female cattle, and their male counterparts
          are known as a bull. They are domestic, bovine animals that feed on
          plants. The average size and color of a cow depending on its type of
          breed. There are many breeds of cows. Some of which are more popular
          like Jersey. The milk-producing capacity of cows is also dependent on
          its type of breed. Larger cows produce more milk, but it is not always
          true. Cows have excellent grazing capabilities. Due to this, certain
          protected grasslands have been declared as anti-grazing zones. Adult
          cows have a set of 32 teeth. There are no upper-level incisors’ or
          canines in a mature cow. Their teeth have smooth surfaces with
          moon-shaped ridges that have been specially designed for an
          herbivorous lifestyle. Cows chew their food all the time. They can
          even take it out from their gut to chew it again properly.
